# Animal Classification Project

**A machine learning project designed to classify animals in images using Python and deep learning techniques.**

## Overview

This project aims to develop an application that can accurately identify the animal present in a given picture. We leverage the power of TensorFlow and other Python libraries to import data, train a model, and deploy it for real-world use.

## Features

- **Data Import**: Robust methods for importing and preprocessing image data for model training.
- **Modeling**: Utilization of advanced machine learning techniques to develop an accurate classification model.
- **Testing**: Rigorous testing phases to evaluate the model's performance.
- **Transfer Learning**: Implementing transfer learning to enhance the model's capability with pre-trained networks.

## Project Structure

- **animal_classification.ipynb**: The main Jupyter notebook containing the ML pipeline from data processing to model training and evaluation.
- **app_flask.ipynb**: A Flask application notebook to deploy the model as a web service, allowing users to upload images and receive classifications.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run `animal_classification.ipynb` to train the model.
4. Execute `app_flask.ipynb` to start the Flask server and interact with the model.
